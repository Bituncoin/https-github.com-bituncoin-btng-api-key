# ✅ BTNG Integration Success Report

## Sovereign Platform Deployment • Demo Sandbox Integration • Backend Readiness

### Overview of the Integration
The BTNG Demo Sandbox has been fully integrated into your sovereign Next.js platform. The integration preserves the institutional identity frame, maintains strict separation between production modules and sandbox modules, and prepares the system for real backend connectivity through your MTN router IP.

This document records the completed work, the architecture preserved, and the next steps toward full backend activation.

### Sovereign Architecture Preservation
- Global identity frame retained across all modules
- Centered BTNG emblem with dual‑mode glow
- Verification‑event chime support
- Multi‑country navigation structure
- Trust Union and Gold Card pathways preserved
- Sandbox isolated under (sandbox)/btng-demo
- No interference with production modules

The sovereign tone, structure, and ceremonial alignment remain intact.

### Files Created and Updated
#### New Sandbox Module
- app/(sandbox)/btng-demo/page.tsx
- app/(sandbox)/btng-demo/BTNGDemoClient.tsx
- app/(sandbox)/btng-demo/btng-demo.css
- app/(sandbox)/btng-demo/btng-demo.js
- app/(sandbox)/btng-demo/README.md

#### Updated Global Components
- components/SovereignHeader.tsx
  - Added 🎮 Demo link to main navigation
  - Positioned for public visibility

### Environment Preparation
- Added BTNG_API_BASE_URL placeholder for future backend integration
- Prepared proxy routes for wallet, explorer, mining, oracle, and PoV

### Demo Features Validated
#### Dashboard
- Live price chart (mocked)
- Market cap, block height, transaction count
- Recent transaction feed

#### Wallet
- Balance display
- Send transaction UI
- QR identity
- Transaction history

#### Mining
- Start/stop simulation
- Difficulty and hash rate display
- Mining log

#### Explorer
- Block search
- Transaction search
- Address search
- Latest blocks and transactions

#### Market
- Price chart
- Market cap
- Circulating supply
- ATH/ATL
- APK QR distribution

All features operate correctly in simulation mode.

### Backend Integration Readiness
The demo is now ready to connect to real BTNG APIs through your MTN router public IP.

#### Required backend endpoints
- /wallet/balance
- /wallet/send
- /wallet/transactions
- /explorer/block
- /explorer/tx
- /explorer/address
- /mining/info
- /oracle/price
- /pov/verify

#### Network plan
- Use MTN router public IP as sovereign backend anchor
- Forward port 64799 to backend machine
- Bind backend to 0.0.0.0:64799
- Replace mock functions with real API calls
- Add SSL + domain once broadband stabilizes

This creates the first operational BTNG node endpoint.

### Next Steps
1. Confirm MTN public IP
2. Forward port 64799
3. Bind backend to that port
4. Test reachability
5. Connect demo to real API
6. Begin OpenAPI specification for BTNG services
7. Prepare domain mapping (api.btng.africa)

Once the backend is reachable, the demo becomes a real BTNG interface.
